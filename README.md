# Athletics
University project

The task conditioning is:
Bobby, Valjo, Mitko, Angel are competing in an athletics competition. The competition contained
three events – triple jump, javelin throw and 100m run. We know about the competition
the following:
1) Bobby placed third in the run.
2) Angel was last in the triple jump,
3) Vallo – third in the javelin.
4) We also know that Vallo was better ranked than Mitko in each of the
the disciplines.
5) The boy who finished second in the triple jump won first place in the shot put
a copy.
6) The boy who placed second in the javelin was first in the run

100 meters.

What is the ranking in each of the disciplines?

Logic created to complete the task:
Here's what we know about the race:
1) Bobby placed third in the run.
2) Angel was last in the triple jump,
3) Vallo – third in the javelin.
4) We also know that Vallo was better
ranking by Mitko in each of the disciplines.

5) The boy who finished second in the triple jump,
won first place in the javelin.
6) The boy who placed second at
the javelin was first in the 100
meters.

What was the ranking in each of the
the disciplines?

Knowing that Valjo has a better ranking than Mitko
in each of the disciplines, we can understand
that Mitko is fourth in the javelin because
Vallo placed third in the event. Also
we know that the boy who placed second at
the javelin was first in the 100
meters. This boy cannot be Valjo and Mitko,
because we already know their ranking and we have Bobbies left
and Angel. We know that Bobby is third in running,
therefore Angel is second in throwing the javelin
and Bobby remains first. The ranking at
javelin throw turns out to be on
first position Bobby, second Angel, third Valjo and
fourth Mitko.

We find out that Angel won the run and Bobby is 3rd
and we have second and fourth positions left. From the rule,
that Valjo was ranked better than Mitko in each
one of the disciplines, we can give the ranking in
the 100 meter run and it is: it is in the first position
Angel, followed by Valjo, Bobby and last is Mitko.
We know that the boy who finished second in the triple jump
won first place in the javelin,
we also know that bobby wins the javelin,
therefore, he is second in the triple jump. So are we
Angel is known to be last in the triple jump.
We have first and third positions left. By the rule that
Valjo is always before Mitko
we understand that Vallo wins the triple jump, after him
in second place is Bobby, followed by Mitko and on
last position is Angel.
